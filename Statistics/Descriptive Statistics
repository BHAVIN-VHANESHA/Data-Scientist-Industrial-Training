=> Random Variables: it is a variable that stores that depends on the outcome of a random phenomenon
e.g:- like tossing a coin, at one time it can be heads or tails so the probability can be 1/2

Types of Random Variables -
1. Numerical RV (like: x = 2, x = 1/2, x = 0.5)
    i. Discrete RV (should be whole number & only +ve/finite number)
    ii. Continuous RV (can have number, float, decimal)
2. Categorical RV (like: x = 'male', x = 'animals', x = 'hello')


=> Covariance: it is a measure to show relation b/w two random variables. Only helps to find the direction of relation
1. Positive Covariance: outcome of the 2 RV tends to move in same direction
2. Negative Covariance: outcome of the 2 RV tends to move in inverse direction
Formula:- cov(x,y) = summation[(x-x(mean))(y-y(mean))] / n-1
to overcome some limitations of Covariance, Pearson Correlation Coefficient was introduced


=> Pearson Correlation Coefficient: it also helps to find the strength of relation b/w 2 RV
Formula:- corr(x,y) = cov(x,y) / Standard Deviation(x) * Standard Deviation(y)
correlation of sample & population
sample: r(x,y) = SD(x,y) / SD(x) * SD(y)
population: p(x,y) = sigma(x) / sigma(x) * sigma(y)


=> Spearman Rank Correlation: it is used when data is ordinal, interval or ratio.
                              It shows monotonic(both variable must increase or decrease) relationship b/w 2 RV & also strength
if there are multiple same value then find mean and rank accordingly
Formula:- r = cov(rank(x) * rank(y)) / SD(x) * SD(y)
mathematical = 1 - 6 summation(difference of sets of rank)^2 / n(n**2 - 1)
def spearman(a,b):
    rank1 = a.rank()
    rank2 = b.rank()
    covariance = rank1.cov(rank2)
    coeff = covariance / (rank1.std() * rank2.std())
    return coeff
OR
use SciPy package
scipy.stats.spearman(a,b)


=> Variable Measurement Scale
1. Dependent Variable
2. Independent Variable
like Linear Regression
Different types of data to measure variable:
1. Nominal (qualitative/categorical data, like gender, cast name, colour, etc.)
2. Ordinal (qualitative data but here order matters but distance does not matter, like cancer stages it does not have same time period b/w 2 stages)
3. Interval (quantitative data, where both order and equal distance b/w values matters & cannot measure in 0)
4. Ratio (same as Interval but value can be measure in 0)
