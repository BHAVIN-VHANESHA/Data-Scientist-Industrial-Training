* Overview *

Statistics is a Mathematical Science use to perform data collection, data analysis, data summarization,
data organization, data interpretation or data presentation.

1. Introduction:
-> types of analysis (quantitative which is statistical analysis & qualitative which is non-statistical analysis)
-> categories of stats
    i. Descriptive Stats (uses population and sample data)
    ii. Inferential Stats (strictly uses sample data)

2. Terminologies:
-> population (superset or everything that is being studied)
-> sample (subset of superset)
-> variable (characteristic, number, quantity that can b e measured)
-> parameter (characteristic of population like avg, total, etc.)

Descriptive Stats
3. Measures of Central Tendency:
-> mean
-> median (values should be shorted)
-> mode (most frequently occurred value)

4. Measures of Spread:
-> standard deviation (it is a measure that describes how each values differs from its mean. Square root of variance)
-> variance (it is the measurement that describes how much a random variable differs from its expected value. (SD)^2)
-> quartile ranges (it is measure based on the dividing a dataset into quartiles. It focuses on more /bulk of values
                    Plots: Box plot, Violin plot.
                    It represents where values lies in 3 different quartiles:Q1=25%, Q2(median)=50%, Q3=75%
                    Inter Quartile Range(IQR) = Q3 - Q1)
steps while defining the IQR:
i. data should be arranged in increasing order
ii. find Q1 & Q3
iii. find IQR
iv. upper bound (Q3 - (1.5 * IQR))
v. lower bound (Q1 - (1.5 * IQR))
NOTE: anything that lies outside lower & upper bound are 'Outliers'
different ways to find outliers: Box plot, Violin plot, Scatter plot, Z-test, IQR

5. Random Variables & types
6. Pearson Correlation
7. Co-Variance

bridge b/w Descriptive Stats & Inferential Stats
8. Spearman Rank Correlation

Inferential Stats
9. Probability:
-> Addition Rule
-> Multiplication Rule
-> Permutation & Combination
-> Bayes Theorem

10. Hypothesis Testing:
-> t-test
-> Z-test
-> f-test
-> Chai-Square Test
-> Type I & II errors
-> p-value & Confidence

11. Central Limit Theorem
12. Skewness

13. Distributions:
-> Normal/Gaussian
-> Binomial
-> Passion's
