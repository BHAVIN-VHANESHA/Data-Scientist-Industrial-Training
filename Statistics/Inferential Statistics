=> Probability: it is a measure of likelihood or chance of particular event will occur
P = no. of ways an event can occur / no. of possible outcomes
e.g:- dice rolling probability
sample space(1 dice): 1,2,3,4,5,6
The value of probability always lies b/w 0-1
two dice: what is prob to get 5 & 7
sample space of 5: 1+4,2+3,3+2,4+1
sample space of 7: 1+6,2+5,3+4,4+3,5+2,1+6
so prob of 5 & 7 = 4/36 * 6/36
so prob of 5 or 7 = 4/36 + 6/36

e.g:- card probability
total cards = 52
Hearts: A,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K
Clubs: A,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K
Spades: A,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K
Diamonds: A,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K

rule of complementary events: Prob(event) + Comp(event) = 1

two types of probability:
1. Conditional (like selecting a boy with specific height or age, ect.)
Bayes Theorem: P(A|B) = P(A intersection B) / P(B)
               P(A|B) = P(A intersection B) / P(A)
P(A)-probability of A occurring
P(B)-probability of B occurring
P(A|B)-probability of A when B has occurred
P(B|A)-probability of B when A has occurred
P(A intersection B)-probability of A & B has occurred

2. Unconditional (like selecting a boy)


=> Addition Rule
Mutually Exclusive: if the two events cannot occur at the same time (like tossing a coin)
Non Mutually Exclusive: if the two events can occur at the same time (like picking a card of heart or king, also it can be both)


=> Multiplication Rule
Independence of event: one event does not affect another event (rolling dice)
Dependence of event: one event affect another event (drawing cards)


=> Permutation & Combination
In permutation order matters & in combination order does not matters
permutation(nPr) = n! / (n - r)!
combination(nCr) = n! / r!(n - r)!
n-total number of objects
r-no. of objects you are picking
